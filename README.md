<h1>Linked List</h1>
<h2>Initial product</h2>
<p>In it’s simplest form, the application has:</p>

<p>Two input fields</p>
<p>One for the title of the bookmark</p>
<p>One for the URL that the bookmark should link to</p>
<p>One for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page</p>
<p>A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:</p>
<p>The title of the bookmark</p>
<p>The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)</p>
<p>A button to “Mark as Read”</p>
<p>A button to “Remove” the bookmark</p>

<h2>Additional features:</h2>
<p>We added in some validation features to keep users from breaking the app. We used a regular expression to check and see</p>
<p>if the URL field contains normal URL character, which will prevent the user from submitting things which are not URLs.</p>
<p>Additionally, we were able to make this application usable both on desktop & mobile.</p>
<p>Finally, we were able to listen to the links being created, as well as the ones that have been "Read" and show those 
totals within the DOM</p>
